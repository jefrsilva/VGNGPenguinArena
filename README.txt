GAME INFO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary objective of this game is to have as much fun as possible. When you
achieve the primary objective you can proceed to the secondary objective that is
to survive as long as possible while scoring many points. The game ends when all
human-controlled penguins are killed by the cute leopard seals on the water.

Just to make sure that all penguins are going to be killed, the ice of the arena
will gradually melt and the number of seals will increase. If you are lucky 
enough to survive will you end in a water arena with a hundred seals to avoid.

Knowing this, you and your friends/opponents will try to keep their penguins on
the ice to avoid being eaten. To avoid this boring scenario the penguins can use
their sliding move to bounce other penguins to their watery grave. If a penguin
has a lot of stamina it will only bounce for a short distance but as it keeps 
getting bounced, it will lose stamina and will be bounced farther each time.
You can eat some red and green fishes to recover stamina but stay away from the
black fish. If you are fast enough, you can try to hit a sliding penguin. This
is what I call a sliding duel. In this case, the penguin who slides first wins
the duel and the other penguin is bounced. If both penguins slide at the same
time then both penguins are bounced.


CHALLENGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the game, random challenges may be issued to all players. These
challenges require the players to complete an objective before the challenge
expires to earn a certain quantity of points. There are two types of challenges:
$red challenges and yellow challenges. The red challenges are completed as soon
as one of the players complete the challenge objective. The yellow challenges
are available only on multiplayer games and they are completed when the
challenge expires.


POWERUPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Powerups fall from the sky randomly during the game. There are 5 types of 
powerup that are described below:

POWER SLIDE (BIG RED FISH) - Your penguin will not stop sliding when you hit
                             other penguins. Additionally, the penguins hit will
                             be thrown farther than normal regardless of their 
                             current stamina.

IRON PENGUIN (BIG GREEN FISH) - Penguins that hit you will be bounced and you
                                will be unaffected by hits.

QUICK SLIDE (BIG YELLOW FISH) - Your slide bar will recover twice as fast.

DOUBLE SPEED (BIG BLUE FISH) - Your penguin will move/slide/swim at double the
                               normal speed.

CONFUSION (RANDOM COLORED FISH) - A random colored fish may give you any of the
                                  4 powerups above but it may give you the
                                  confusion powerup that inverts all of your
                                  controls.
